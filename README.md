# Hack-the-Bay

### Background

This project centered around pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. Our goal was to visualize pollution in the bay and show how it has changed over time. We were provided with a massive dataset with numerous different pollution datapoints, which were divided by the regions of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This data comes primarily from the CMC (Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative), and the CBP (Chesapeake Bay Program), and includes pollution measurement indicators such as water temperature, PH levels, and conductivity.

### Cleaning the data

While the data was clean, relatively speaking, there was still work to be done in order for it to be usable in Tableau. We first had to merge the data into one file, as the data came from two different sources.
